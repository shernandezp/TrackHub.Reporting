// Tenant-scope coverage (TS-06), delegated to the shared engine in Common.Application.Testing so
// every service enforces the identical gate (including keys WRAPPED inside request DTOs). Two
// invariants: (1) a request that resolves no AccountId but carries a wire entity key must declare
// how its scope is enforced — [AccountScopeEnforcedInHandler] / [PlatformScoped] /
// [AllowCrossAccount]; (2) a request whose scope is enforced per-caller must not be [Caching] —
// the cache key carries only request fields, so the cached response leaks across accounts (SVD-09).
