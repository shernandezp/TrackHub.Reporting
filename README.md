## Overview

The Reporting API generates Excel reports by composing data from the other services: master data and GPS integration from the **Management API**, live/stored positions from the **Router API**, geofences from the **Geofencing API**, and position history, operator health, and sync-run telemetry from the **Telemetry API**.
